NOTE: The padding bytes are assumptions and may not be paddings at al, however as there are almost always a few nullbytes/paddingbytes at the end of animation it is assumed that these are in the file to pad the file to 4 bytes

Other research: When one of the unknowns is too high it seems to be causing an EOF error which isn't handled which could mean they are some kind of padding indicators
